# 📹 Tokopedia Play Clone 
This project is a development of back-end service for Tokopedia Play, submitted for the mid-term project of Full Stack Engineering on GIGIH 3.0 Program. It uses Node.js and Express.js for building the APIs and MongoDB for the database. For the frontend-side, this project uses React.js and chakraUI for the UI library.

### 📹 Feature
This web has 2 main pages:
`Homepage` and `video detail page`, which can be accessed when you click/choose one of the videos available on the homepage.
In the `video detail page`, you will be served with the youtube video that you chose earlier. This page also contains `comments` and a `comment` form for you to submit. And after that, there's a `list of other products`.

### 🗃️ Database Structure
MongoDB is utilized to store data (document) regarding to Tokopedia Play's requirements.
The database basically has 3 collections:
- `videos`
- `products`
- `comments`

![db schema](./assets/database.png)

**Products and comments collections are getting videoID from the videos collection.**
#### videos
This collection stored video thumbnail documents with the following schema:
```json
{
	"_id": "string",
	"imgURL": "string"
}
```

#### products
This collection stored product documents with the following schema:
```json
{
    "_id": "string",
    "videoID": "string",
    "productID": "string",
    "title": "string",
    "price": "string"
}
```

#### comments
This collection stored comments from the user with the following schema:
```json
{
    "_id": "string",
    "videoID": "string",
    "username": "string",
    "timestamp": "string"
}
```
## API's Structure
![api structure](./assets/structure.png)
As the image shows, the back-end system consists of models, routes, and controllers, as well as MongoDB for the database.
- `routes` will act as a delivery between the system and the user, where routes will be the media of sending responses and receiving requests for the user. 
- `controllers`  have functions in it where it is positioned between routes and models. The controller will receive the request from `routes`, process it, and take the data needed from the `model` layer.
- `models` carries the data schema and works with the `controller` to handle data from the database.
- `user/client` acts as a party that will be sending request and receiving response from the system.
